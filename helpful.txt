What is Population ??
Population is way of automatically replacing a path in document with actual documents 
from other collections. E.g. Replace the user id in a document with the data of that user.

Some points about populate:
. If no document is found to populate, then field will be null.
. In case of array of documents, if documents are not found, it will be an empty array.
. You can chain populate method for populating multiple fields.
. If two populate methods, populate same field, second populate overrides the first one.
